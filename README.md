# Dart IO Nike Gen
Dart is a program designed to efficiently assist with entering Nike raffle product releases. Dart generates Nike Accounts using multi-threaded browser automation, allowing the tool to create accounts in mass which increases chances of winning product releases. 

Note: I wrote this program when I first learned Golang in 2021, so the code is quite messy.

## Features
- Multi-threaded account generation
- Ability to choose from multiple SMS services
- Proxy support
